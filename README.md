# to-do-notes

## The Idea
I am building this a simple, user friendly todo list, with the following features: \
    - Cookie Free \
    - No login required \
    - Ad Free \
    - Stored Memory 

## Growth
In the future I will be looking to implement more features, including: \
    - Option logging in and saving across devices \
    - Re ordering of the list \
    - Notes section \
    - Dark Mode \
    - + Any suggestions 

## Open Source
Feel free to use the exisiting code base as much as you would like, completely free
