# to-do-notes

## The Idea
I am building this a simple, user friendly todo list, with the following features:
    - Cookie Free
    - No login required
    - Ad Free
    - Stored Memory

## Growth
In the future I will be looking to implement more features, including:
    - Option logging in and saving across devices
    - Re ordering of the list
    - Notes section 
    - Dark Mode
    - + Any suggestions

## Open Source
Feel free to use the exisiting code base as much as you would like, completely free
